            <p>I'm Winnie Odhiambo, a software developer based in Kenya.
                Currently I'm a student at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology, persuing a Bsc. in Information
                Technology.
                I'm interested in building my skills in software development and be able to solve challenges using
                technology.
                As I continue to grow in the field, I make it a priority to stay connected with the tech community by
                regularly
                attending tech talks,workshops and local meetups to stay updated on latest industry trends.
            </p>

            <p>Whether it's through collaborative projects or individual learning, I thrive on opportunities to push my
                skills further and bring ideas to life.</p>

            <p> Outside tech and school work, I enjoy being with family and friends, watching cooking shows and trying
                out new recipes,
                reading random books, listening to music and trying out new DIY crafts.</p>

            <p> I'm open to collaborations in tech space, job opportunities and mentorship.
