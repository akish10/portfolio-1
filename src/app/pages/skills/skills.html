                <h2>“On Learning Slowly”</h2>
                <p>I used to rush tutorials.<br>
                    Skim docs. Copy code. Move fast.<br>
                    But I never remembered what I stole.<br>
                    Now I read the docs like novels — slowly, with curiosity.<br>
                    Learning isn’t speedrunning. It’s gardening.</p>

                <h2>“Coffee, Keyboards, and the Weight of Thought”</h2>
                <p>My desk is quiet but full:<br>
                    Cold brew. Crumbs. A terminal window half-closed.<br>
                    I sit here and build things that don’t exist yet.<br>
                    Isn’t that wild?<br>
                    Just me, a keyboard, and belief.</p>

                <h2>“AI Feels Like Talking to Myself with Better Grammar”</h2>
                <p>It completes my sentences.<br>
                    Suggests better ones.<br>
                    And yet, I wonder if I’m becoming more concise… or just less human.</p>

                <h2>“What the Commit Message Didn’t Say”</h2>
                <p><code>fix minor issue with nav</code><br>
                    But that issue wasn’t minor to me.<br>
                    It represented the tenth thing I got wrong that week.<br>
                    Some days I wish version control applied to life.<br>
                    <code>git revert mistakes/december/2024</code>

                <h2>“A Bug That Broke Me (Then Built Me Again)”</h2>
                <p>It was two lines.<br>
                    Two lines in a tangled forest.<br>
                    I lost a week chasing ghosts through console logs and caffeine.<br>
                    But when I found it, I didn’t feel relief — I felt humbled.<br>
                    The system wasn’t wrong. My assumptions were.</p>

                <h2>“The Version of Me That Never Learned to Let Go”</h2>
                <p>I hold onto ideas too long.<br>
                    Projects, people, lines of code.<br>
                    Maybe because letting go feels like disrespecting the effort.<br>
                    But keeping things past their time clutters the mind.<br>
                    Even in memory, you need garbage collection.</p>
