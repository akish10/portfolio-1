    <section>
        <h4>Portfolio</h4>
        <p>A website showcasing my skills, projects I have worked on and professional experiences.(Hey, I'm the portfolio website!)</p>
        <p>Some skills learnt:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Angular and TypeScript</li>
            <li>Github Actions Workflows</li>

        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h4><a href="" target="_blank">ShopIt</a></h4>
        <p>An e-commerce platform for buying and selling products.<br> The idea is that buyers can post their products
            and interested buyers get to buy directly from them, no need of a middleman in between</p>
        <p> Some of the skills learnt:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web Design</li>
            <li>HTML5</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Python and Django</li>
            <li> Database design with Django Models - (This one really tested my understanding of database schemas).</li>
            <li>Software design - (I really struggled with this and had to make several corrections).</li>

        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="last-section">
        <h4> <a href="https://github.com/akish10/vehiclesbook" target="_blank">VehiclesBook</a></h4>
        <p>A website to allow farmers to book vehicles to carry their produce to the market</p>
        <p>This project helped me learn how different components work together,when and how to use a function and some
            key programming concepts.</p>

        <p> Some key takeaways from this project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It never hurts to get your hands dirty with code</li>
            <li> Have a design document before you start implementing code - (It saves time and you have less confusion)
            </li>
            <li>Be open to learning new concepts</li>
        </ul>
